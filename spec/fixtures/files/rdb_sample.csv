The model features time variation in agents’ preference for safe bonds with a global flight-to-safety (GFS) component biased toward dollar-denominated safe bonds. Our estimation produces two main findings. First, GFS shocks are the most important driver of international business cycles. Second, GFS shocks contribute to the resolution of exchange rate puzzles. Movements in the dollar are largely accounted for by the GFS and other fundamental shocks, whereas pure deviations from uncovered interest rate parity play a more limited role.",,,"Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.

A model of UI is calibrated to replicate experiences of the eligible and ineligible, including consumption after job loss. Eligibility rules distort labor supply in costly ways and removing them would benefit workers across the income spectrum, even with consideration of funding costs. The model captures job-finding rates by eligibility that I document during the GFC and COVID-19 recessions. Although expanded eligibility during COVID-19 lowered job-finding rates, other changes in UI policy were more impactful.",,,"Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.

Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute)",114,"Who will gain and who will lose as AI automates tasks? While much of the discourse focuses on job displacement, we show that job transformation—a shift in the task content of jobs—creates large and heterogeneous earnings effects. We develop a quantitative, task-based model where occupations bundle multiple tasks and workers possessing heterogeneous portfolios of task-specific skills select into occupations by comparative advantage. Automation shifts the relative importance of tasks within each occupation, inducing wage effects that we characterize analytically. To quantify these effects, we measure the task content of jobs using natural language processing, estimate the distribution of task-specific skills, and exploit mappings to prominent automation exposure measures to identify task-specific automation shocks. We apply the framework to analyze automation by large language models (LLMs). Within highly exposed occupations, like office and administrative roles, workers specialized in information-processing tasks leave and suffer wage losses. By contrast, those specialized in customer-facing and coordination tasks stay and experience wage gains as work rebalances toward their strengths. Our findings challenge the common assumption that automation exposure equates to wage losses.",,,"Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.

Theoretically, we show that for fixed trade elasticity, different models predict identical trade flows, but different patterns of microlevel price variation. Thus, given data on trade flows and micro-level prices, different models have different implied trade elasticities and welfare gains. Empirically, models with extensive or variable mark-up margins yield significantly larger welfare gains. Our trade elasticity estimates are robust over time in contrast to leading approaches that use trade-flow and tariff data, which imply a common trade elasticity across models.",,,"Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.

China and Mexico are still the two countries characterized as middle-income by the World Bank with the highest levels of merchandise exports. Although their measures of openness have been comparable, these two countries have had sharply different economic performances: China has achieved spectacular growth, whereas Mexico’s growth has been disappointingly modest. In this article, we extend the analysis of Kehoe and Ruhl (2010) to account for the differences in these experiences. We show that China opened its economy while it was still achieving rapid growth from shifting employment out of agriculture and into manufacturing while Mexico opened long after its comparable phase of structural transformation. China is only now catching up with Mexico in terms of GDP per working-age person, and it still lags behind in terms of the fraction of its population engaged in agriculture. Furthermore, we argue that China has been able to move up a ladder of quality and technological sophistication in the composition of its exports and production, while Mexico seems to be stuck exporting a fixed set of products to its North American neighbors.",,,"Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.
